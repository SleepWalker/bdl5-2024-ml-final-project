    By default the n_trials specifies trials count per worker.
    So if you use multiple processes you will have some issues:
    - you should know exactly how much workers will it be to pick correct value
    - if some of workers will reach it's n_trials faster, you'll get an idle
      worker which could do some work otherwise
    - if you'll restart the process â€” trial count will start from scratch without
      accounting for earlier finished trials
